        <h1>My Bio</h1>
        <p>I'm originally from Orange County, CA and graduated from Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton. 
          When I was young, I spent my time at swim team practice (3rd grade through highshool), playing video games (overclocking my graphics card to squeeze out a few etra fps), or maybe even playing the trumpet in a mariachi band.

        <h3 class="text-muted">Education Paragraph</h3>
        <p>My post-secondary studies took me to Washington, D.C. where I earned my B.S. in Foreign Service: Science, Technology, and International Affairs from Georgetown University in 2011.
          As a Hoya, I walked onto the men's lighweight rowing team, racing teams from other storied institutions up and down the east coast.
        (Fun Fact: I had an award named after me, to henceforth be given to a rower who “…displays an impeccable work ethic, commitment to his teammates and devotion to the goals of the [team].”)
        Later in life, I took a career break to pursue a full-time MBA, graduating from the UCLA Anderson School of Management in 2018.  At Anderson served as EVP, Anderson Veterans Association, and VP, Operations, Management Consulting Association.
        Currently I'm pursing another degree, this time a Masters in Data Science at the UC Berkeley School of Information.
        My favorite coursework so far has been in experiment design and deep learning for natural language processing (NLP).

        <h3 class="text-muted">Work Paragraph</h3>
        <p>Motivated by a mix of patriotism and desire to continue challenging myself physically and mentally, I entered the United States Marine Corps Officer Candidate School after undergrad. 
          I also saw this as an opportunity to grow what I perceived to be a weakness of mine (leadership) with hands on experience, and I proudly was comissioned as a Second Lieutenant at the end of 2011. 
          Over four years of active duty and one year of active reserves, I served as a field artillery officer,
          with responsibilities for leading Marines, providing precise trajectory calculations, subject matter liason with foreign militaries, and coordinating operations and logistics.
          I used my two years post-military to receive my MBA, and pivoted into the private sector with a job at APM Terminals Los Angeles.
          I started my career at APM (a part of the A.P. Moller-Maersk Group) in a management training rotational program called "Go With Maersk".  
          As part of the program, I met with a global cohort of ~60 members a few times a year for executive education and collaborative workshops.
          After the program ended, I continued working in Los Angeles as a Operations Strategy and Planning Manager, then most recently as a 
          Operations Strategy Modernization Manager supporting a massively ambitious transformation to automated container terminal operations. </p>
